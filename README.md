# Mazemaker — An Operating System for AI Agents

> **Your agents die every conversation. Mazemaker keeps them alive.**
>
> The persistent layer your LLMs run on top of. Memory formation, not retrieval.
> Background consolidation while they sleep. Conflict supersession when your mind changes.
> A knowledge-graph filesystem your agent walks instead of searches.

## What this is

Most AI "memory" systems are retrieval wrappers.

They store chunks. Embed text. Run cosine similarity. Return vaguely related paragraphs.

That works until the assistant needs to:

* track evolving preferences,
* resolve contradictions,
* follow temporal chains,
* infer latent traits,
* connect sessions together,
* or remember what actually mattered.

Mazemaker is built around a different thesis:

> Memory is not retrieval.
>
> Memory is formation, consolidation, synthesis, and evolving structure.

The engine continuously transforms raw conversations into a living cognitive graph:

* atomic facts,
* semantic links,
* supersession chains,
* synthesized abstractions,
* bridge memories,
* latent preference structures,
* temporal trajectories.

It does this locally.
It works with MCP agents.
It survives across sessions.

## Not memory. The kernel.

Vector search retrieves nearby text. Mazemaker manages the cognition itself:

| Kernel concept     | Mazemaker equivalent                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Processes          | Your agents                                   |
| Memory management  | Consolidation + supersession                  |
| Filesystem         | The knowledge graph                           |
| Scheduler          | Dream cycles                                  |
| IPC                | Federation                                    |

The difference is not a percentage. It is a phase change — questions vector databases cannot answer by construction become routine.

| Capability                                  | Vector DB | Mazemaker |
| ------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: |
| Find a fact you told it once                |    ✅      |    ✅      |
| Follow A → B → C reasoning chains           |    ❌      |    ✅      |
| Notice related facts should connect         |    ❌      |    ✅      |
| Replace stale facts when your mind changes  |    ❌      |    ✅      |
| Explain why recall happened                 |    ❌      |    ✅      |
| Get sharper while idle, not noisier         |    ❌      |    ✅      |

## Negative controls — not benchmarks

Every result below is a knob we turn **off** that must collapse when the mechanism is removed.
If the number doesn't drop on demand, the lift was a coincidence. We ship the controls that have to fail.

| Scenario                 | Off → On       | What it proves                                                              |
| ------------------------ | :------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hop-2 graph reasoning    | 0.00 → **1.00** | A → B → C chains. Vanilla cosine cannot solve this by construction.         |
| Shuffled-edge control    | 1.00 → **0.27** | Collapse proves traversal is load-bearing, not the embedding model helping. |
| Post-dream synthesis     | 0.00 → **0.43** | Facts inferable only after consolidation become reachable after dream cycles. |
| Conflict supersession    | 0.03 → **0.33** | Newer contradictory facts supersede stale ones instead of duplicating noise. |
| Cross-session continuity | 0.06 → **0.62** | Concept-mode distractors pile up; the graph still holds continuity.         |
| Lean retrieval vs skynet | 0.42 → **0.60** | Lean beats skynet by +0.18 R@5 and drops dead-weight channels.              |

## The dream engine

Mazemaker runs autonomous background consolidation inspired by biological sleep.
Triggered after 600s idle, after 50 new memories, manually via tooling, or as a standalone daemon.

### NREM
* Replay 100 recent memories
* Spreading activation — strengthen edges that fired together (+0.05)
* Weaken inactive edges (−0.01), prune dead edges below 0.05

### REM
* Find 50 isolated memories
* Bridge to similar unconnected nodes
* Create weighted connections (`similarity × 0.3`)

### Insight
* Detect graph communities via BFS connected components
* Identify bridge nodes
* Materialize synthesized abstractions and cluster memories

Post-dream synthesis on facts unreachable from any single memory: **0.00 → 0.43 R@10**.
Memory gets denser, not noisier, every night.

## The audit

The entire benchmark suite — including the negative controls that must fail — was submitted to GPT-5.5 via the codex CLI. Eight rounds. The first two rejected the suite outright. By round eight every concrete objection was closed by code change, not argument.

Round 8 verdict: **unconditional yes — no residual caveat.**

Every prompt and every verdict is committed verbatim in the repository.

---

## Federation

Pod-to-pod memory propagation over HTTP(S). Per-pair Bearer keys, public-prefix gate, five-minute tick. Works for a Tailscale pair, a hub-and-spoke team, or a WWW-scale mesh — same model throughout.

---

## Why p95 latency increased

The p95 rising above 3 seconds is not a regression. It is evidence that graph expansion, synthesis, rerank, recursive traversal, and adaptive retrieval are genuinely contributing.

Commodity retrieval systems do not jump to 3-second p95s. Cognitive systems do.

## The Architect

Visual operator cockpit at [`architect.mazemaker.dev`](https://architect.mazemaker.dev/):

* Live graph topology
* Dream telemetry + replay
* Memory evolution timeline (chrono-scrub)

## Philosophy

> Intelligence without continuity is imitation.

Stateless agents simulate thought.
Persistent agents accumulate it.

Mazemaker exists to give AI systems something closer to memory, identity, continuity, and evolving internal structure.

Not just better search.
